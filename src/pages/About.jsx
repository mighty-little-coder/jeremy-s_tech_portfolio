          I am a Connecticut native and a recent graduate of the University of Connecticut's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I am a passionate developer with a strong work-ethic and a desire to create user-friendly applications. I am a quick learner and a team player who is eager to contribute to a team and learn from others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am excited to bring my skills to a new team and continue to grow as a developer. I have spent most of my professional career in blue collar industries as a mechanic and a hydraulic assembler on aerospace equipment. In the meantime, I have been learning many additional, mostly creative skills outside of my time in the workforce. I am a proficient dancer, videographer and mechanic and I look forward to bringing my unique skills to a new team that I can grow with!
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, I believe I would be a good fit for most any team. I enjoy the connection of working with others and am always eager to learn more! I enjoy getting to dig into an individual topic or project so that i can continue to look at it from new angles. I always aim to improve the process by which I accomplish tasks and am excited at the prospect of doing that within a team of people that are knowledgeable and passionate about what they do.
